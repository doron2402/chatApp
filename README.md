How to run:

1. git clone 
2. npm install 
3. node server.js
4. open your browser: http://localhost:3000 or http://127.0.0.1:3000


- you can change the port number at hosts file.
- user can change his name from guest to whatever name you want by typing /nick <your nick name> (without < > yes just the name).
- user can join or create a room by typing /join <room name>
- you can create custom command by editing the "Chat.prototype.processCommand" function at the chat.js file for example you want to add a color to the user background and so on.


Good Luck, feel free to ask me questions.
